Chapter 1: Clean Code


What is bad Code?
If code is not understandable like a good book, the complexity needs long time to understand and documentation is unclear or not avaible, "To do" list is long,
and no clear structur and reusability is not given...
the "red line" in the code is maybe visible but different ways/ possbilities are not clear. 

What is the cost of bad code?
(productivity vs time)
To go forward adding code to such structures will distroy productivity and creativity and need exponential more time.
Redesign is not possible because it is nearly unpossible to build the structure to reqonstruct the ways without copieng the mess in it.
In each way it is a waste of time. Ofcourse it is important that clean code will use more time too, but at the end it will need maybe the same time.
The difference is at the same investment of time the base in clean code for going forward and build more creativity instead of stagnation. The goal it to write instead of repairing. For this the right way of refactoring is a key element,

Attitude: 
Why does this happen to code? Why does good code rot so quickly into bad code?
But the fault, dear Dilbert, is not in our stars, but in ourselves.We are unprofessional.

A philosphy in the managment and in the company strategy is needed.
The need is to see the awesome creativty in the clean code. This can have issuess too but they have to be at the todo list and it needs the discilpine to work first with the todo and then adding new code.
